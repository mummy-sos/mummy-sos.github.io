        <div>Mummy SOS is actually owned, managed and run by an experienced and highly
            qualified childcare practitioner who personally oversees every event!</div>

        <div>In addition to a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Business Management and Working
            with Children, Alexandra has undertaken a diverse range of vocational courses in
            childcare. Over her 7 years working with children and families, Alexandra has developed
            Mummy SOS to provide the uniquely flexible childcare services parents desire.</div>

                    <div>Alexandra Zetter, Owner Manager of Mummy SOS</div>
                    <div>AKA Nanny Alex</div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>Alexandra explains why her company is so unique:</div>

            <div>What sets us apart from most companies in the market is that we act as an employer, rather than just
                an
                agency. This means that our nannies and babysitters actually work for and are employed by the company,
                Mummy
                SOS
                Ltd. The benefit this provides is that our staff and clients have a lot less to worry about. We have our
                own
                fully comprehensive insurance, and we organise all contracts, interviews, policies and procedures
                internally, as
                well as fully covering the enhanced CRB check for every member of our staff. All taxes and NICs are
                taken
                care
                of through our payroll system, so the only person who needs to worry about doing the maths is our
                accountant!
            </div>
            <div>Initially beginning as a flexible home childcare service, offering nannying and babysitting services
                for
                families throught London and Hertfordshire, we now provide highly sought after, uniquely flexible Event
                Childcare Services across Hertfordshire and the surrounding areas.</div>
            <div>As we continue to expand and take on new ventures, our goal remains the same: to provide the best
                possible care for every child and the best possible support for every family that we work with.
