        <div class="intro">Our event childcare has always been focused on providing the best possible care for each
            individual child, and in these
            difficult times, our priority remains ensuring that every child is comfortable in our care, and every parent
            confident
            in our provision.</div>
        <blockquote>“We used Alex from Mummy SOS for our wedding to look after our
            15 month old son. He was born during COVID and not used to other
            people caring for him or putting him to sleep. During our initial phone
            call she was professional and took her time to understand our worries
            and requirements. On her pre event visit she was very well prepared and put
            us and our son instantly at ease. On the night she collected him at 6.30 pm,
            took him back to our hotel, cared for him overnight and brought a very happy
            and smiling baby back to us at 9am. We could not have been better pleased
            and would definitely recommend Mummy SOS! We thought that the cost was very
            reasonable for the excellent service provided. Thanks to Mummy SOS my husband
            and I knew that our son was well looked after, letting us relax and fully enjoy
            the evening as husband and wife - not mum and dad!”
