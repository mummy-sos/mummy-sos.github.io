    <div>OUR EVENT CHILDCARE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE
        FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD, AND IN THESE DIFFICULT TIMES, OUR PRIORITY REMAINS
        ENSURING THAT EVERY CHILD IS COMFORTABLE IN OUR CARE, AND EVERY PARENT
        CONFIDENT IN OUR PROVISION.</div>
    <blockquote>“We used Alex from Mummy SOS for our wedding to look after our
        15 month old son. He was born during COVID and not used to other
        people caring for him or putting him to sleep. During our initial phone
        call she was professional and took her time to understand our worries
        and requirements. On her pre event visit she was very well prepared and put
        us and our son instantly at ease. On the night she collected him at 6.30 pm,
        took him back to our hotel, cared for him overnight and brought a very happy
        and smiling baby back to us at 9am. We could not have been better pleased
        and would definitely recommend Mummy SOS! We thought that the cost was very
        reasonable for the excellent service provided. Thanks to Mummy SOS my husband
        and I knew that our son was well looked after, letting us relax and fully enjoy
        the evening as husband and wife - not mum and dad!” </blockquote>
